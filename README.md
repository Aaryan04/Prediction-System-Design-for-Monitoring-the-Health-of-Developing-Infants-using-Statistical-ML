# Prediction-System-Design-for-Monitoring-the-Health-of-Developing-Infants-using-Statistical-ML

I have converged my research skills by co-authoring and publishing a research paper titled ‘Prediction System Design for Monitoring the Health of Developing Infants from Cardiotocography Using Statistical Machine Learning’ in the Design Engineering-Scopus Journal. Cardiotocography is a low-cost means of monitoring fetal health and lowering the child fatality rate. On the fetal health dataset, we did machine learning classification, beginning with exploratory data analysis to determine the pattern and distribution of each feature. Our ML model efficaciously distinguished between normal and abnormal fetal health and was accurate enough in its predictions to avoid any unnecessary interventive surgical procedures, lowering the overall risk of child mortality. The problem of class imbalance was solved using data sampling techniques SMOTE(Synthetic oversampling minority technique) and ADASYN(Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach). I have used five different classification algorithms namely Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes classifier to each of the three different sampled data: Actual, SMOTE, and ADASYN. On comparing the statistical metrics and analyzing the final results, the best performing algorithm was the Random Forest Classifier on a SMOTE data sample with the highest accuracy of 94% among all the remaining algorithms.
